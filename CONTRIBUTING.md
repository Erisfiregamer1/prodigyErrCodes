## How to contribute more errors


If you know the error code and trigger:
- [Use our discussions tab](https://github.com/ProdigyErrorCodes/ProdigyErrorCodes/discussions/categories/new-codes-triggers)
-------
If you know the error code and trigger, and you also know exactly how to format your addition:
- [Open a pull request](https://github.com/ProdigyErrorCodes/ProdigyErrorCodes/pulls).
- PLEASE NAME YOUR COMMITS `See ! LIST.md` WHEN PUSHING COMMITS. This keeps the repo clean. (You can add a description in the more details section).
